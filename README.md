### **Adding a Note**

When adding a note you are able to choose from the current topics and techs or create new ones by choosing the `"None of the above"` option.

Finally you are asked to provide both a tile and a body for the note.

See below for an example:

### **Searching Notes**

When searching your notes you are asked to provide the name of the technology you are searching for. Please only search for valid tech names - **no characters that aren't in the alphabet!**

### **Browsing Notes**

When you choose to browse your notes you will be asked to choose both the topic and tech that you wish to browse.

The notes will then all be printed to your terminal as shown below:

### **Backup Notes**

Finally, something I recommend doing regularly, you have the option to backup your notes. Just in case something goes wrong!
