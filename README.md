# Cheat-CLI

A command line tool that you can use to create your own local cheatsheets.

## Get Started

**Please follow these steps to setup setup the Cheat-CLI on your machine:**

First fork the project then clone the repo into your HOME directory, then change directory into `.cheat-cli` and run the following command:

```sh
npm run setup
```

---

## Usage

The cheatsheets are designed to be divided into **topics** (e.g. backend) and techs (e.g. express) and can be found in the cheatsheets directory. I have included a couple of topics to get you started but you are able to add as many as you like!

Use the command `npm run cheat` to add notes to a cheatsheet of your choice.

\* I will make it so you can use the `cheat` command globallybut currently I'm working on a way to browse your notes and edit/delete them.
